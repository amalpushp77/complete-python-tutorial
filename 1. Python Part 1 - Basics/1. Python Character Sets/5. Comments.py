# multi-line comments are used for document string


# Physical newline vs logical newline (for readability purpose)
# logical newline
# implicit - list, tuple, dictionary, set, function arguments/parameters
# Explicit - by using backslash character \
# note - when using logical newline explicitly, comments can't be written on same line
