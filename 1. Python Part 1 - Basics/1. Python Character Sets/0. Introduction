Introduction to Python -
Python is known as an interpreted scripting language. Gudo van Rossum designed it. It was released in the year 1991. The
different versions were released for Python like python 1, python 2 and python 3. It is one of the most used scripting
languages for automating the modules and tools, development of web applications, handling big data, complex
calculations, workflow creation, rapid prototyping, and other software development purposes.

Highlights of Python

1. Platform independent

2. Interpreted
The python code does not need to compile as required for other languages. Python code automatically converts the source
code into byte code internally, and the code is executed line by line, not at once, so it takes more time to execute the
code for the application.

3. Simple to understand

4. Rich library support

5. Embeddable
Python source code can be put into a different language to use. This helps in integrating the functionality of the
python program with other languages.

6. Open-source
Python is open source and readily available over the internet anywhere. One does not need to take the license of it.
It can be easily downloaded and use.

7. Dynamically typed
It is dynamically typed, which means that the type of value will be decided at run time. This is the reason why the
programmers donâ€™t declare the type of variable earlier.

Applications based on Python

Web applications and frameworks

Scientific Application


Disadvantages of Python
Not so good for mobile application development
It has limitations with database access, not suitable for enterprise that deals with complex legacy data (JDBC/ODBC).
Difficult for programmers to deal with runtime error, require more testing.
High memory consumption - not good for memory intensive task.
Slow speed.
High power consumption.
Need more maintenance of application and code.
