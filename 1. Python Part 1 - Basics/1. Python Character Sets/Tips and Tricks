So, these are the 10 simple yet most useful tips on Python programming:-

1. Modules
The best thing about python is that you can create your own modules. For example, I can create my own function and
modules and place them all together in a separate folder. So what I do is I write down specific codes, which I know I
would be used in common in most of my work, then convert them into a module and keep them aside in a separate folder.
By doing this, I save a lot of time, from writing them again and debugging them to check for errors. Another reason is
that you need to keep your program efficient and manageable if they are big in size. To manage this, you can break them
into separate files, put multiple functions and definitions into a file and use them by importing them into scripts and
programs. Note that these files will have a *.py extension. And once you import them, it will auto-create a *.pyc
extension file that will load much quicker than the normal *.py file.

2. True and False
True equals to 1, and False equals to 0 in python. In short, true means
you agree and false means you disagree. These things are used most often in python. So, you can either assign True
and False statements by using the “=” sign, or you can check the equality by using the “==” sign. As simple as that.

3. Python Performance debug
When writing a program, our main goal is to make the program efficient, fast and compact. But there are times, when you
simply cannot make the program compact. So at these times, you may not actually want to make the program compact to
make it faster. What you can do is, for example, when handling codes in a dictionary, you can try an alternate method
of dictating an item. Confused? Let me explain this. You can simply choose to add an item directly and then check
whether the inserted items exist or need to be updated. So, by doing this, you don’t need to check each and every
other item to match with it and then update it, which kind of will make the application slow. Following is a famous
example of that:

p = 16
myDiction = {}
for i in range(0, p):
    char = 'abcd'[i%4]
        if char not in myDict:
            myDiction[char] = 0
        myDiction[char] += 1
print(myDiction)

The above example is the normal way of writing it. Now here is how it will make the code run faster,

p = 16
myDiction = {}
for I in range(0, p):
    char = ‘abcd’[i%4]
    try:
        myDiction[char] += 1
    except KeyError:
        myDiction[char] = 1
print(myDiction)

4. Py2exe
Another useful tip I can think of is py2exe. Normally, when writing a code in any language, it can sometimes be a
hassle to compile them into an executable, especially if you are using windows. But for Python Programming, it’s
actually very simple. You can simply download py2exe, which again is open-source software that you can download
from sourceforge.net. Using this app, you can simply convert even your modules into an exe, unlike C or C++, which i
s actually stress of mind when compiling into an exe.

5. Sets
 Sets are extremely useful when creating databases. Especially when you want to
find matches, create groups and other similar tasks.

>>> A = {1, 2, 3, 3}
>>> A
set([1, 2, 3])
>>> B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
>>> B
set([3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
>>> A | B
set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
>>> A & B
set([3])
>>> A - B
set([1, 2])
>>> B - A
set([4, 5, 6, 7])
>>> A ^ B
set([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7])
>>> (A ^ B) == ((A - B) | (B - A))
True

6. Merging Python and Shell Scripts
Now, this is something you can’t do with C or C++. If you are an open-source guy, you would surely use Linux as the main
Operating OS, or at least a Dual Boot. So, Linux already includes python. And python is extremely compatible with Linux.
This gives us the benefit of compiling and merging them together. You can simply create a script that can work as a
normal Unix script as well as an interpreted Python code at the same time. When writing a shell script, you need a
four quote character and an empty string to the shell, but you need to do that with a triple-quoted string with a
quote character in python. Remember that the first string in a script can be easily stored as a doc string for a
module, but after that, the python interpreter will simply ignore it.

An example is as follows:

#!/bin/sh
__doc__ = """
Demonstrate how to mix Python + shell script.
"""
import sys
print("Hello World!")
print("This is Python", sys.version)
print("This is my argument vector:", sys.argv)
print("This is my doc string:", __doc__)
sys.exit(0)

7. JSON-esque
You can create nested dictionaries without explicitly creating sub-dictionaries. They magically come into existence as
we reference them.

Example as follows:

users = tree()
users['harold']['username'] = 'hrldcpr'
users['handler']['username'] = 'matthandlersux'

Now you can print the above as JSON with:

>>>print(json.dumps(users))

And it will look like this

{"harold": {"username": "hrldcpr"}, "handler": {"username": "matthandlersux"}}

8. Pip

>>> pip install --download sqlalchemy_download sqlalchemy
>>>pip install --no-install sqlalchemy
>>>pip install --no-download sqlalchemy

If you want to install the bleeding-edge version of a package, you can directly check it from the GIT repository.

>>>pip install git+https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson.git
>>>pip install svn+svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zope.interface/trunk

9. Virtualenv

easy_install pip
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv python-workspace
cd python-workspace
source ./bin/activate
python
