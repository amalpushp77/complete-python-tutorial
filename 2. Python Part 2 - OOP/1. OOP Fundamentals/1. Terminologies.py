""" Programming languages can be classified into 3 primary types
        1. Unstructured Programming Languages
        2. Structured/Procedural oriented Programming Languages
        3. Object Oriented Programming Languages"""


# Everything in python is an object belonging from some class
"""
# 1. sequential programming
# Disadvantage:
#     1. long code
#     2. slow program
a = 5+3  # 1. addition
print(a) # 2.  print addition value

b = 4+5 # 1. addition
print(b) # 2.  print addition value

c = 7+9 # 1. addition
print(c) # 2.  print addition value

# 2. Procedural programming
# function
def add(num1, num2):
    c = num1+num2
    print(c)

add(5,3)  # 1. addtion and 2. print addtion value
add(4,5)
add(7,9)

# 3. object oriented programming
# class

""" Object Oriented Programming Terminologies


        1) Class - A user-defined prototype/blueprint for an object
        2) Instance (Object) − An individual object of a certain class.
        3) Instantiation (Object creation) − The creation of an instance of a class.
        4) Class variable - A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a
            class but outside any of the class's methods. Mainly used to declare constants.
        5) Instance variable -  A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a
            class.
        6) Data member -  A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.
        7) Instance Methods - A function that is defined in a class definition
        8) Special/Magic/Dunder Methods - Magic methods in Python are the special methods that start and end with the
            double underscores.
        9) Static Methods - @staticmethod decorator is used, generally use static methods to create utility functions
        10) Class Methods - @classmethod decorator is used, generally use class method to create factory methods.
            Factory methods return class object ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.
